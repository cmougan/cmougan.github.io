In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of how to tackle high cardinality categorical features with the quantile.
Our proposal outperforms state-of-the-art encoders, including the traditional statistical mean target encoder,
when considering the Mean Absolute Error, especially in the presence of long-tailed or skewed distributions
