I have a passion for predictive modeling and its implications in society. 
At the moment I am in the topics of explainable ML and fairness.

I am very fortunate to have been able to pursue these passions at world-class research and public institutions.

I currently am a __Marie Curie Research Fellow__ and Ph.D. Candidate in the NoBias European Innovative Training Network.
My research is currently focused on what is actually Explainable ML and how to evaluate it.
